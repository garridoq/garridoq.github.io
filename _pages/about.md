I'm Quentin Garrido, a PhD student at Meta AI - FAIR and LIGM working on **Self-Supervised Learning**.

My particular area of focus is on joint embedding architectures applied to images and videos, but I also have an interest in leveraging these methods in other domains.



Previously, I obtained my master degree from the [Mathématiques,Vision, Apprentissage (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/) program at [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).
I also hold an engineering degree from [ESIEE Paris](https://www.esiee.fr/) in computer science.
