I'm Quentin Garrido, a Research Scientist at Fair at META working broadly on **Self-Supervised Learning** and **World Models**.

My resarch focuses primarily on self-supervised learning and it's application to computer vision and natural sciences.
More recently, my research has pivoted towards video understanding and building world models from natural data (e.g. raw videos).

Previously, I obtained a PhD in computer science from <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">FAIR at Meta</a> and <a href="https://www.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/en/">Université Gustave Eiffel</a>, co-advised by <a href="https://yann.lecun.com/">Yann LeCun</a> and <a href="https://www.laurentnajman.org/">Laurent Najman</a>.
I also hold a master degree from the [Mathématiques,Vision, Apprentissage (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/) program at [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/),
as well as an engineering degree from [ESIEE Paris](https://www.esiee.fr/) in computer science.
