I'm Quentin Garrido, a final year PhD student at Meta - FAIR and Université Gustave Eiffel working broadly on **Self-Supervised Learning**.

My resarch focuses primarily on self-supervised learning and it's application to computer vision and natural sciences.
More recently, my research has pivoted towards video understanding and building world models from natural data (e.g. raw videos).

Previously, I obtained my master degree from the [Mathématiques,Vision, Apprentissage (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/) program at [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).
I also hold an engineering degree from [ESIEE Paris](https://www.esiee.fr/) in computer science.
